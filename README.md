### About Framework

 Personal framework template that is quick and simplified to help you get started on test projects faster.
 I recommend building it as a jar file and referencing it in your projects. It comes with AI plugins, 
 common utilities for Web UI automation testing (Selenium with Java, Maven, TestNg), 
 REST API testing (Rest Assured), 
 Cloud based test execution (BrowserStack and Sauce labs), 
 CI support (Jenkins) and custom test reporting.

### Requirements
TBD


### Build
Change to the directory that contains the pom.xml execute the maven command:
build cmd: mvn clean install
